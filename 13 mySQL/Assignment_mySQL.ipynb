    "DDL mean data definition language(DDL) is subset of SQL and part of DBMS.DDL consists of certain command and help to create or modify the tables in SQL.\n",
    "Commands\n",
    "1)Create\n",

    "Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "Ans:DML means DATA Manipulation Language and it is category of SQL. At a time we actually want to execute some complicated data interaction. we will nedd DML in this situation.\n",
    "For DML statements, control over the transaction is needed. The alteration that DML statement does to the database is called a transaction. Thus, if any adjustment is made via DML statement, then it will be managed by Transaction Control Language(TCL) statements. It is also SQL statements’ subset that can go on to modify the data in tables. It also chiefly focuses on performance of the database, while it makes use of the append-only feature of the Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS) storage.\n",
    "DML are two types -\n",
    "\n",
    "1)High-level or Non-Procedural DML\n",
    "    a)it is set for a particular time or highly series oriented\n",
    "    b)it can be used on its own for precisely specifying complex operations in the database.\n",
    "    c)prescriptive(relating to the imposition or enforcement of a rule or method) in nature.\n",
    "    d)it demand that a user must clearly state which data is needed without clarifying how and when to obtain those data.\n",
    "    e)example- Every SQL statement is a prescriptive command.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Low-level or Procedural DML\n",
    "    a)lablled as track-at-a time DML.\n",
    "    b)it must be integrated to a general-purpose programming language.\n",
    "    c)indispensable in nature.\n",
    "    d)It demands that a user must clearly state which data is needed and how to obtain those data.\n",
    "    e)eg: DB2’s SQL PL, Oracle’s PL/SQL.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands are as follows\n",
    "1) SELECT command\n",
    "syntax: SELECT * FROM <table_name>;\n",
    "eg: SELECT * FROM <student>\n",
    "\n",
    "2)INSERT \n",
    "syntax: INSERT INTO <table_name> ('column_name1' <datatype>)\n",
    "VALUES ('value1');\n",
    "eg:\n",
    "INSERT INTO std('std_fee' INT)\n",
    "VALUES('1');\n",
    "\n",
    "3)UPDATE\n",
    "syntax:\n",
    "UPDATE <table_name>\n",
    "SET <column_name = value>\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "\n",
    "eg:\n",
    "UPDATE students\n",
    "\n",
    "SET due_fees = 20000\n",
    "\n",
    "WHERE stu_name = 'Mini';\n",
    "\n",
    "4)DELETE \n",
    "syntax\n",
    "DELETE FROM <table_name>\n",
    "WHERE <condition>;\n",
    "eg: \n",
    "DELETE FROM student\n",
    "WHERE stu_id = '101'\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages :\n",
    "\n",
    "1)DML statements could alter the data that is contained or stored in the database.\n",
    "2)It delivers effective human contact with the machine.\n",
    "User could specify what data is required.\n",
    "3)DML aims to have many different varieties and functionalities between vendors providing databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages :\n",
    "1. We cannot use DML to change the structure of the database..\n",
    "2. Limit table view i.e., it could conceal some columns in tables.\n",
    "3. Access the data without having the data stored in the object.\n",
    "4. Unable to build or erase lists or sections using DML."

    "Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "Ans: Structured Query Language (SQL) is a nonprocedural language used for retrieving data from the queries.\n",
    "1. DQL statement are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects.\n",
    "2. The purpose of the DQL command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it.\n",
    "3.  DQL as follows it is a component of SQL statement that allows getting data from the database and imposing order upon it.\n",

    "Characteristics of DQL: \n",

    "syntax: SELECT * FROM <table_name>\n",
    "\n",
    "eg: SELECT * FROM student_id\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. SELECT is a standard command used for almost every query.\n",
    "2. It can also be written as SELECT as SQL is a case-insensitive language.\n",
    "3. It makes the data retrieving process easier.\n",
    "4. No coding is needed.\n",
    "5. This domain language can be used for communicating with the databases and receive answers to complex questions in seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Query Language has no disadvantages.\n",
    "1. It is not possible to imagine Structured Query Language without the select command.\n",
    "2. Interfacing a DQL database is more complex than adding a few lines of code.\n",
    "3. The operating cost of some DQL versions makes it difficult for some programmers to access them.\n",

    "\n",
    "Applications: \n",
    "    a. Analytical Queries.\n",
    "    b. Retrieve Information from the database.\n",
